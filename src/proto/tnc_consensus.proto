/**
 * Transaction Network Consensus Interface using Raft over Coaty provided by TN
 * Connector.
 *
 * This gRPC service enables a TN connector to share distributed state within
 * the transaction network using Raft over Coaty consensus algorithm.
 *
 * This service maintains a replicated state machine (RSM) shared by all Raft
 * nodes within a Raft cluster in the Coaty network using the Raft protocol.
 * Replicated state is represented as a key-value store with key-value pairs
 * that can be set, changed, or removed. Whereas keys are strings, values can be
 * any JSON compatible value represented by Protobuf well-known type
 * `google.protobuf.Value`.
 *
 * After creating a new Raft node with `Create` you have to call `Connect`
 * before it can modify/access the replicated state with the following
 * methods:
 *
 * - `Propose` proposes a new input that should be applied to the RSM.
 * - `GetState` returns the state of the RSM.
 * - `ObserveState` emits new state on every RSM change.
 *
 * After a Raft node has connected to the Raft cluster it can monitor the
 * cluster configuration with the following methods:
 *
 * - `GetClusterConfiguration` returns the cluster configuration.
 * - `ObserveClusterConfiguration` emits new configuration on every cluster
 *    configuration change.
 *
 * Use `Disconnect` to disconnect a Raft node from its cluster. Use `Stop` to
 * temporarily leave the cluster without losing persisted state.
 *
 * Note that in order to use this service you have to configure the TNC
 * Communication service via rpc method `Configure` first.
